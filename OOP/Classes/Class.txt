Classes are user defined types declared with keyword class that has data and functions . 
Although classes and structures have the same type of functionality, there are some basic differences. 
The data members of a class are private by default and the members of a structure are public by default.
Along with storing multiple data in a common block, it also assigns some functions (known as methods) to manipulate/access them. 
It serves as the building block of Object Oriented Programming.

It also has access specifiers, which restrict the access of member elements. The primarily used ones are the following:

public: Public members (variables, methods) can be accessed from anywhere the code is visible.
private: Private members can be accessed only by other member functions, and it can not be accessed outside of class.

Example:

class SampleClass {
    private:
        int val;
    public:
        void set(int a) {
            val = a;
        }
        int get() {
            return val;
        }
};
