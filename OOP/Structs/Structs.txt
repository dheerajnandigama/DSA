Struct is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure.

Example:

we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his 
age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int).

Representation:

struct NewType {
    type1 value1;
    type2 value2;
    .
    .
    .
    typeN valueN;
};
